# Test Resources and Documentation

## Official Documentation

### XCTest Framework
**URL**: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest

The official Apple documentation for XCTest framework, which includes:
- XCTest fundamentals
- XCUITest for UI testing
- Performance testing
- Test assertions and expectations
- Test organization and execution
- Accessibility testing
- Network and location testing

## Key XCTest Components

### XCUIApplication
- Launch and manage applications under test
- Access to app lifecycle methods
- Bundle identifier-based app targeting

### XCUIElement
- Interact with UI elements
- Query and find elements
- Perform actions (tap, swipe, type, etc.)

### XCUIElementQuery
- Query elements by type, identifier, label
- Predicate-based element filtering
- Element existence and state verification

### XCTAssert Functions
- Assertion methods for test validation
- Boolean, equality, and nil checks
- Custom failure messages

### Performance Metrics
- XCTApplicationLaunchMetric
- XCTMemoryMetric
- XCTStorageMetric
- XCTClockMetric

## Project-Specific Resources

### FindMy App Testing
- **Bundle ID**: `com.apple.findmy`
- **Target**: iOS built-in FindMy application
- **Test Framework**: XCTest UI Testing

### Custom Test Infrastructure
- **TestContext**: Singleton for managing test context and shared data
- **Location**: `FindMeAppCTLTestUITests/TestContext.swift`

- [Writing Tests for Your App](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/writing-tests-for-your-app)

### Best Practices
- Use accessibility identifiers for reliable element queries
- Implement proper wait conditions for asynchronous operations
- Keep tests independent and isolated
- Use TestContext singleton for shared test data
- Clean up state between tests

## Notes
- Always refer to the official XCTest documentation for the most up-to-date APIs
- Check for iOS version-specific features and deprecations
- Use Xcode's built-in test recording feature to generate initial test code
