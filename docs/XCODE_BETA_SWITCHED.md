### Switch Back to Stable (if needed)
```bash

## Important Notes

### Device Testing
When testing on your real device (Chi Thu – iPhone (180)):
1. **Unlock the device** - Xcode Beta needs the device unlocked
2. **Trust the computer** - Accept trust prompt if shown
3. **Wait for device preparation** - First time may take a few minutes

### Build Considerations
- Clean build recommended after switching: `make clean && make build`
- Some warnings about macOS version are normal (doesn't affect iOS builds)
- Device must be unlocked for builds and tests

### Opening Project
To open project in Xcode Beta:
```bash
open -a "Xcode-beta" FindMeAppCTLTest.xcodeproj
```

Or use the default open command (will use Beta since it's now active):
```bash
make open
```

## Testing with Xcode Beta

### On Your Real Device
```bash
# 1. Unlock your iPhone
# 2. Run tests
make test-device-tabs
```

### On New Simulators
```bash
# iPhone 17 Pro
xcodebuild test \
  -project FindMeAppCTLTest.xcodeproj \
  -scheme FindMeAppCTLTest \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17 Pro' \
  -only-testing:FindMeAppCTLTestUITests/testNavigateThroughAllTabs
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Device is locked"
**Solution:** Unlock your iPhone and try again

### "Developer disk image could not be unmounted"
**Solution:** 
1. Unlock device
2. Disconnect and reconnect device
3. Wait for Xcode to prepare device

### "Timed out waiting for destinations"
**Solution:**
1. Ensure device is unlocked
2. Check device is connected
3. Open Xcode Beta and let it prepare the device

### Build Warnings
The warning about macOS version is normal and doesn't affect iOS builds. You can ignore it.

## Next Steps

1. **Unlock your device**
2. **Open project in Xcode Beta:**
   ```bash
   open -a "Xcode-beta" FindMeAppCTLTest.xcodeproj
   ```
3. **Let Xcode prepare your device** (first time only)
4. **Run tests:**
   ```bash
   make test-device-tabs
   ```

## Switching Back

If you need to switch back to stable Xcode:
```bash
make switch-xcode-stable
make clean
make build
```
